## Problem description


Under the Delta variant, how do **vaccine efficacy (VE)** and **coverage**, alongside border quarantine, change the risk and timing of a community outbreak? Drawing on Zachreson et al. (2022) [@zachreson2022], I seek practical thresholds that keep breach risk near baseline and extend the time to 50% outbreak probability (*t*₅₀). **Policy relevance:** *t*₅₀ indicates how long health systems can delay sustained community transmission, guiding vaccine targeting, quarantine settings, and surge preparedness.

The modelling baseline was calibrated to pre-Delta data from Australia and New Zealand, scenarios then examined Delta-era transmissibility (**R₀** ≈ 6, explored **5–10**) and VE in the 0.5–0.9 range.




## Analysis

All results and parameter settings in this section are adapted from Zachreson et al. (2022) [@zachreson2022], with some minor modifications by the author.


### 1) Breach risk within quarantine
- Risk scales with transmissibility (R₀) and falls with higher VE. From the pre-Delta baseline (R₀ = 3, VE = 0), holding breach risk near baseline under Delta-era settings requires:
  - VE ≥ 60% at R₀ = 6 
  - VE ≥ 70% at R₀ = 8 
  - VE ~70–80% at R₀ = 10 (a “saturation” effect appears because travellers are cohorted, if infection control outside close contacts slips, risk rises sharply).
- Facility controls are pivotal. Relaxing traveller↔traveller/worker contact reductions by an Order-of-magnitude can increase breach risk by up to two orders of magnitude, overwhelming moderate VE gains.

### 2) Community outbreak timing (*t*₅₀)
- Non-linear gains with VE × coverage. At VE < 60%, even full coverage gives limited protection. Once VE ≥ 80%, *t*₅₀ rises steeply as coverage passes ~80% (see Figure @fig-delta).
- Order-of-magnitude delay is achievable. Compared with baseline ~15 days (R₀ = 3, VE = 0), an optimal mix—e.g., VE ≈ 90% with coverage ≥ 80% at R₀ = 6–10 can extend *t*₅₀ to ~1000 days.


The following ** @fig-delta** and **@tbl-ve-thresholds** visualise and quantify these threshold effects.

In contrast, VE ≥ 80% combined with coverage ≳ 80% produces threshold jumps that extend outbreak-free time from weeks (~15 days baseline) to months–years (~1000 days). High coverage cannot compensate for low VE as transmissibility increases."

This illustrates how higher VE and coverage jointly drive a disproportionate reduction in outbreak risk."

### 3) Practical thresholds 
To keep breach risk ~baseline as R₀ rises: target VE ≥ 60% (R₀ = 6), VE ≥ 70% (R₀ = 8), for R₀ ≈ 10, plan for ~70–80% VE plus strict facility controls.
To materially extend t₅₀: aim for VE ≥ 80% and coverage ≥ 80%, the largest marginal gain is 80% → 90% VE at high coverage.
Quarantine ≠ substitute for community protection. It buys time only if paired with mass vaccination and tight infection control.



### 4) Robustness (sensitivity highlights)
Shorter incubation (Delta like) improves detection dynamics → longer t₅₀.
If VE acts mainly via reduced infectiousness (VT) (vs. infection blocking, VI), the VE threshold drops by ~20% to maintain baseline risk.
Lower symptomatic fraction increases hidden spread, shrinking t₅₀, but leaves the approximate VE thresholds above unchanged.



## Conclusion
This analysis highlights how vaccine efficacy (VE), coverage, and border quarantine measures jointly shape the risk and timing of COVID-19 community outbreaks under the Delta variant. Based on the modelling work by Zachreson et al. (2022) [@zachreson2022], the key implication is that border quarantine alone is insufficient to maintain low outbreak risk in high transmissibility settings.

Maintaining baseline breach risk requires higher VE thresholds as R₀ increases, with strict facility infection control remaining essential. High VE (≥80%) combined with broad population coverage (≥80%) can delay outbreaks by an Order-of-magnitude compared with pre-Delta baselines, while weaker vaccination strategies offer only marginal protection.

These findings reinforce that border quarantine should be viewed as a complementary and time buying measure, not a standalone solution. Sustained outbreak prevention depends on pairing quarantine controls with strong vaccination programs, enabling jurisdictions with low local transmission to keep risk near baseline and extend outbreak free periods.
