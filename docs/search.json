    "section": "Analysis",
    "text": "Analysis\nAll results and parameter settings in this section are adapted from Zachreson et al. (2022) (Zachreson et al. 2022), with some minor modifications by the author.\n\n1) Breach risk within quarantine\n\nRisk scales with transmissibility (R₀) and falls with higher VE. From the pre-Delta baseline (R₀ = 3, VE = 0), holding breach risk near baseline under Delta-era settings requires:\n\nVE ≥ 60% at R₀ = 6\nVE ≥ 70% at R₀ = 8\nVE ~70–80% at R₀ = 10 (a “saturation” effect appears because travellers are cohorted, if infection control outside close contacts slips, risk rises sharply).\n\nFacility controls are pivotal. Relaxing traveller↔︎traveller/worker contact reductions by an Order-of-magnitude can increase breach risk by up to two orders of magnitude, overwhelming moderate VE gains.\n\n\n\n2) Community outbreak timing (t₅₀)\n\nNon-linear gains with VE × coverage. At VE &lt; 60%, even full coverage gives limited protection. Once VE ≥ 80%, t₅₀ rises steeply as coverage passes ~80% (see Figure Figure 1).\nOrder-of-magnitude delay is achievable. Compared with baseline ~15 days (R₀ = 3, VE = 0), an optimal mix—e.g., VE ≈ 90% with coverage ≥ 80% at R₀ = 6–10 can extend t₅₀ to ~1000 days.\n\nThe following figure and Table 1 visualise and quantify these threshold effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Across R₀=5–10, t₅₀ rises non-linearly with VE×coverage: below VE≈60% gains are modest even at full coverage, while VE≥80% combined with coverage ≳80% produces threshold jumps that extend outbreak-free time from weeks (~15 days baseline) to months–years (~1000 days), high coverage cannot compensate for low VE as transmissibility increases.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs summarised in Table Table 1, moving from VE 80% (coverage 60%) to VE 90% (coverage 80%) shifts t₅₀ from ~320 to ~1000 days, while VE 50% even at 80% coverage yields only ~35 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario\nR₀\nVE (%)\nCoverage (%)\nt₅₀ (days)\nRisk vs Baseline\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nBaseline (no vaccine)\n3\n0\n0\n15\n–\nPre-Delta reference with high breach risk and rapid outbreak.\n\n\nHigh efficacy, moderate coverage\n6\n80\n60\n320\n↓ 80%\nModerate coverage + high VE substantially extends t₅₀.\n\n\nHigh efficacy, high coverage\n8\n90\n80\n1,000\n↓ 95%\nVery high VE + coverage delays outbreaks for years.\n\n\nLow efficacy, high coverage\n8\n50\n80\n35\n↓ 20%\nCoverage alone insufficient when VE is low under high transmissibility.\n\n\n\nt₅₀ = time to 50% outbreak probability. Data patterns adapted from Zachreson et al. (2022), Science Advances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: The table synthesizes scenario results showing that t₅₀ increases non-linearly with rising VE and coverage exhibiting threshold effects around VE ≥ 80% and coverage ≈ 80% that can extend outbreak-free periods from weeks to years, whereas high coverage with low VE yields only modest gains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3) Practical thresholds\nTo keep breach risk ~baseline as R₀ rises: target VE ≥ 60% (R₀ = 6), VE ≥ 70% (R₀ = 8), for R₀ ≈ 10, plan for ~70–80% VE plus strict facility controls. To materially extend t₅₀: aim for VE ≥ 80% and coverage ≥ 80%, the largest marginal gain is 80% → 90% VE at high coverage. Quarantine ≠ substitute for community protection. It buys time only if paired with mass vaccination and tight infection control.\n\n\n4) Robustness (sensitivity highlights)\nShorter incubation (Delta like) improves detection dynamics → longer t₅₀. If VE acts mainly via reduced infectiousness (VT) (vs. infection blocking, VI), the VE threshold drops by ~20% to maintain baseline risk. Lower symptomatic fraction increases hidden spread, shrinking t₅₀, but leaves the approximate VE thresholds above unchanged."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThis analysis highlights how vaccine efficacy (VE), coverage, and border quarantine measures jointly shape the risk and timing of COVID-19 community outbreaks under the Delta variant. Based on the modelling work by Zachreson et al. (2022) (Zachreson et al. 2022), the key implication is that border quarantine alone is insufficient to maintain low outbreak risk in high transmissibility settings.\nMaintaining baseline breach risk requires higher VE thresholds as R₀ increases, with strict facility infection control remaining essential. High VE (≥80%) combined with broad population coverage (≥80%) can delay outbreaks by an Order-of-magnitude compared with pre-Delta baselines, while weaker vaccination strategies offer only marginal protection.\nThese findings reinforce that border quarantine should be viewed as a complementary and time buying measure, not a standalone solution. Sustained outbreak prevention depends on pairing quarantine controls with strong vaccination programs, enabling jurisdictions with low local transmission to keep risk near baseline and extend outbreak free periods."
